### Grafana v6.4.2 + node_exporter 0.18.1 test pass

#### The dashboard is quite practical, to optimize the main metrics for display, and supporting Node Exporter v0.16 and above.Includes: CPU,memory,disk I/O, network traffic, temperature and other monitoring metrics.

## Notes:

------
#### After import the dashboard, please click `Dashboardsettings`-- `Variables` to set the variable in the upper right corner of the dashboard according to the actual situation。

**The three variables:`$job`, `$hostname` and `$node` will be set and associated by default. **(`$name`, `$env` variable is a custom label and was hidden. You can increase by yourself if needed.)

- `$node` takes the `instance` of node_exporter, `ip:port` format. Most queries are associated with this variable, please make sure it is valid.

- `$maxmount` is used to check the maximum partition of the current host. Normally can only obtain partitions of type `ext4` and `xfs` by default.
