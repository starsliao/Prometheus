### Compatibility Release Notes:
If you post the dashboard, you get an error:
```
Failed create dashboard model
Cannot read property 'Symbol(Symbol.iterator)' of undefined
```
Note that your grafana version is too low, does not support the new BAR GAUGE chart, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of grafana, or re-import version without BAR GAUGE:
